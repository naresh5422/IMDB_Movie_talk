1. We can develop the IMDB movie review based on given text using different NLP techniques.

2. in this IMDB movie review project, Applied different machine learning algorithms to predict the movie is positive or negative

3. in this project, go with SVM algorithm because of the algorithm is gives best accuracy which is 88.05% compare with remaining algorithms without using Hyperparameters

    a). Support vector Machine Classifier: 88.05%
    b). Logistic Regression Classifier: 87.28%
    c). Random Forest Classifier: 84.40%
    d). Naive Bayes(BernoulliNB) Classifier: 84.1%
    e). Decision Tree Classifier: 71.84%
